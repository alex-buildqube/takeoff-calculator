# Implementation Prompt: RFC-009 – Centroid Reposition (Measurement Move by Centroid)

Implement **RFC-009: Centroid Reposition (Measurement Move by Centroid)** in strict accordance with the RFC document.

## Purpose

Add an API that, given a measurement and a new centroid, returns the measurement with its geometry translated so the centroid lies at the given point, enabling end users to drag a centroid and update the position of the measurement in consumer apps.

## Instructions

1. **Read the full RFC**: Open and follow `RFCs/RFC-009-*.md` (the RFC file for this ID). All technical details, acceptance criteria, APIs, data models, and constraints are defined there.

2. **Scope**: Implement only what is specified in RFC-009. Do not add functionality that belongs to later RFCs. Do not skip required items from the RFC.

3. **Dependencies**: This RFC builds on prior RFCs (listed in the RFC document). Assume those are already implemented. Use existing interfaces and patterns from the codebase.

4. **Output**:
   - Code, configuration, and any artifacts required by the RFC.
   - Tests that satisfy the RFC's acceptance criteria and testing strategy.
   - Updates to documentation or schema as specified in the RFC.

5. **Verification**: Before considering the task complete, confirm every acceptance criterion in the RFC is met and that no placeholder or stub remains unless the RFC explicitly allows it.

## Reference

- **RFC document**: `RFCs/RFC-009-*.md`
- **Master index**: `RFCs/RFCS.md`

Implement RFC-009 in full according to the RFC document; do not deviate from its scope or add features from other RFCs.
